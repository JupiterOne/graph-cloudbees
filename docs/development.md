# Development

This integration focuses on CloudBees CI and is using
[CloudBees CI API](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-ci-api/latest/api-authentication)
and [Jenkins API](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/remote-access-api/) for
interacting with the Hexnode resources.

## Prerequisites
